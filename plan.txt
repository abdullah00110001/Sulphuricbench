# Mobile App Deployment Plan

## Prerequisites
1. Install Android Studio (for Android)
2. Install Xcode (for iOS, Mac only)
3. Install Node.js (v16 or higher)
4. Install Git

## Step 1: Setup Development Environment
1. Export project to GitHub using "Export to Github" button in Lovable
2. Clone the repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd [project-name]
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Step 2: Configure Capacitor
1. Add platforms:
   ```bash
   npx cap add android
   npx cap add ios
   ```

2. Update native platform dependencies:
   ```bash
   npx cap update android
   npx cap update ios
   ```

## Step 3: Build and Sync
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Sync with native platforms:
   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   ```

## Step 4: Run on Device/Emulator
### Android:
```bash
npx cap run android
```

### iOS (Mac only):
```bash
npx cap run ios
```

## Step 5: Testing
- Test all authentication flows
- Test payment integration
- Test course access
- Test dashboard functionality
- Test offline capabilities

## Step 6: Production Build
1. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   ```

2. Open in native IDE:
   - Android: `npx cap open android`
   - iOS: `npx cap open ios`

3. Generate signed APK/AAB for Android or IPA for iOS

## Troubleshooting
- If build fails, run `npm run build` first
- If sync issues occur, delete platforms and re-add them
- Check capacitor.config.ts for correct URLs
- Ensure all permissions are set in native configs

## Current Issues to Fix:
1. âœ… Build errors in edge functions (FIXED)
2. ðŸ”§ My Courses access denied issue
3. ðŸ”§ Invoice UI redesign
4. ðŸ”§ Payment History data display
5. ðŸ”§ Review section topic selection

## Next Steps:
After mobile setup, address the UI/UX issues mentioned for better user experience.
